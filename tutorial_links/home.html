<h1>General purpose:</h1>
<p>While working on my independent study, I noticed when working with MapBox the neat MapBox map tutorial was that I had to constantly make new HTML and JavaScript files to make the data compatible with each individual map I made. To mitigate creating constant files, I reworked their tutorial and created MapBr -  MapB(ox)R(endering) to ultimately do one simple thing: To create shareable maps from large sets of coordinate data with time stamped data that were created with MapBox.</p>
<p>Please note that mapbR is used for plotting coordinates over a single day with what time they occured during the day. You can use various scripts to group up these occurences for what time and this would need to be uploaded to Mapbox. More details in the other tabs.</p>
